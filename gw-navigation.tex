\section{Objective}
Investigate whether gravitational waves can be used to identify and exploit shortened travel paths in space by predicting the timing, direction, and strength of oncoming gravitational waves.

\section{Hypothesis}
Gravitational waves could provide temporary spacetime distortions that, if predicted and harnessed, may shorten the effective travel distance for spacecraft.

\section{Methodology}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection}: Use LIGO/Virgo and future detectors to monitor gravitational wave events and their spacetime impact.
    \item \textbf{Simulation}: Model how gravitational waves distort spacetime and explore the feasibility of rerouting spacecraft to utilize these distortions.
    \item \textbf{Prediction Algorithm}: Develop AI algorithms capable of predicting the appearance and effects of gravitational waves based on observational data.
    \item \textbf{Feasibility Test}: Simulate spacecraft navigation adjustments in response to predicted gravitational wave distortions to assess practical impact.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Expected Outcome}
Determine if it's feasible to predict and utilize gravitational wave events to shorten effective travel paths, reducing fuel costs and travel time.
