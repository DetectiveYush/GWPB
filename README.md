# Utilizing Gravitational Waves to Shorten Space Travel Paths

## Objective
Investigate whether gravitational waves can be used to identify and exploit shortened travel paths in space by predicting the timing, direction, and strength of oncoming gravitational waves.

## Hypothesis
Gravitational waves could provide temporary spacetime distortions that, if predicted and harnessed, may shorten the effective travel distance for spacecraft.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Use LIGO/Virgo and future detectors to monitor gravitational wave events and their spacetime impact.
2. **Simulation**: Model how gravitational waves distort spacetime and explore the feasibility of rerouting spacecraft to utilize these distortions.
3. **Prediction Algorithm**: Develop AI algorithms capable of predicting the appearance and effects of gravitational waves based on observational data.
4. **Feasibility Test**: Simulate spacecraft navigation adjustments in response to predicted gravitational wave distortions to assess practical impact.

## Expected Outcome
Determine if it's feasible to predict and utilize gravitational wave events to shorten effective travel paths, reducing fuel costs and travel time.
